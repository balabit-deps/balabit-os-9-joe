    closes: #508159.
  * Fix the various segfaults when called with more than one file, d'oh.
    Thanks to Oyvind Aabling for a patch, but actually it seems that
    this was a copy&waste error that crept up into the 3.7 tarball yet
    was coded properly in CVS (main.c r1.79), so simply used that line

     + 009_sprintf_to_snprintf: renamed/merged from 009_percent_number_s,
       because the purpose is mostly the same -- fixes some sprintfs to be

        "I think this is one of the patches for the segfault on large files"
      + 001_missing_headers: two headers needed for the thing to compile
      + 002_int_to_long: changes to some casts, int -> long
      + 003_renamed_stuff: renaming of *_alloc functions and variables
      + 004_terminal_init: terminal initialization stuff

    compiling with -Wall. (hopefully I didn't wreck something)
  * Added Wichert's changes from the -15.1 potato NMU, closes: #77676
      + safe creation of DEADJOE in order to prevent nastiness, closes: #34524
        (added to 008_protect_deadjoe, with an addition of defining
        _GNU_SOURCE in there because O_NOFOLLOW isn't defined otherwise)
